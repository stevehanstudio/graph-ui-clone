# ComplexObjectTreeView

This project is a React.js/Typescript component, built for the healthcare company, Plenful, through Open Avenue's micro-internship program, to visualize a complex data object.

## Dependencies

This project uses Material UI, Material UI icons, and the TreeView component in Material-UI Lab.

Note: Material UI currently does not work with React 18, so we need to use React 17

To install dependencies

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @mui/lab
```

## Usage

To import

```
import Component from './steve/index.tsx'
```

To render the component and optionally provide a title.

```
<Component title='My Graph-UI Component' />
```

If no title is provided the title 'Complex Object TreeView' will be shown as the title.
